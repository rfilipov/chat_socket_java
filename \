java sockets text and files 
TO DO:
 	1. Sleep beatween sending data blocks is not always needed
		
		-sleep(0) means that the shared resources used by one thread are freed if some other thread wants to used them.
		
		-we need to free the socket(shared resources) only if there is text message waiting to be send, if there is not
		 stoping the already working thread is waist of time and resoures
			
			-find an action that can stop a thread only if some event has happend(IMPORTANT), wait(), notify()

	2. Overhead for chunk sending
		
		-the headers send need to be as small as possible because the larger the  head is more usless information is send
		 via the socket 

		-chunks need to be dynamicly allocated becauce if we have large files and small chunks a lot of overhead for
		 headres will be used, if the chunks are large and the files are small a lot of empty chunks will be send which
		 is waistful

		-decresing the header size down to a byte because overhead will become smaller(using bit operations)
	
		-size of the chunk needs to be as big as the time it is needed to be send  to be 1 sec 
		
	3. Multiple files being send(preority for files being send)
		
		-using some sort of queue where each file is represented by chunks and there is a header at the beging of every
		 new file
	
		-loading big amound of data in the queue for sending multiple files, should be made on portions not at ones
                 because otherwise 200gb of data may need to be loaded at ones
